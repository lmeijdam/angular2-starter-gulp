# Angular 2 Ultimate Starter Project
This is a basic starter project for developers who want to develop with Angular 2 in combination with gulp. Please keep in mind that Angular 2 is still in beta! Also keep in mind this is my first Angular 2 project. Tips and suggestions are most welcome.

## Usage
To use this project please do the following steps;

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmeijdam/angular2-starter-gulp
```
- Install all the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
- Run the app

```bash
npm start
```

Keep in mind that the app, view and style folder are created when starting/compiling the app. Please also make sure you have NodeJs installed.
